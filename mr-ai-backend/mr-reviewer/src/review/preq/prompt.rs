///
/// ## Contract enforced on the model
/// - **Return exactly one JSON object on a single line** (no markdown fences, no prose).
/// - **Include all four keys**; never omit any key.
/// - `queries`, `need_paths_like`, `need_symbols_like`: arrays of strings, length â‰¤ 3. Use `[]` when empty.
/// - `reason`: non-empty string (never null/omitted). If nothing is needed: `"No extra context needed"`.
/// - **No "thinking", no comments, no trailing text**.
///
/// This reduces ambiguity and prevents the model from dropping fields, which previously
/// led to empty blocks in the cleaner.
